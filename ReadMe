I found Error In expand_percent, the function cannot process value have multiple percent(%)

For example: 50%% should be => ((50/100)/100)

I also add test cases in test_calculator.py file
    - test_multiple_100_percent
    - test_two_multiple_percents

For test_main.py I add test case as instruction the test case are
    - test_multiplication_symbol
    - test_division_symbol
    - test_basic_addition
    - test_basic_subtraction
    - test_multiple_percent

But I found bug that I cannot fix in calculator when I click a single percent icon it got double percent
    I record in Calculator-client_bug.mov
